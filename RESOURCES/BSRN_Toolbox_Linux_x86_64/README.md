BSRN Toolbox
============

The BSRN Toolbox is a software package supplied by the WRMC and is freely available to all station scientists and data users. The main features of the package include a download manager for Station- to-Archive files, a tool to convert files into human readable TAB-separated ASCII-tables (similar to those output by the PANGAEA database), and a tool to check data sets for violations of the "BSRN Global Network recommended QC tests, V2.0" quality criteria. The latter tool creates quality codes, one per measured value, indicating if the data are "physically possible," "extremely rare," or if "intercomparison limits are exceeded." In addition, auxiliary data such as solar zenith angle or global calculated from diffuse and direct can be output.
